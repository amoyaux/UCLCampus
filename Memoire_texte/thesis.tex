\chapter{Introduction} % Major section

Brief introduction of the project, the goals and the contents of the rest of the thesis.


\chapter{Background}

In this section, we will look at the different existing technologies relating to the different aspects of our project and will explain the choices we made. 

\section{Cross-platform mobile development tools}

In each of these sections, we will detail the different approaches one could choose to develop a cross-platform moblie applications. We will also present several frameworks using these approaches. We will then compare them and choose one of those approaches for the rest of the project. 
\subsection{The native approach}

The first approach we considered for our project was what we call a native approach. The native approach consists in using the native technology and language for each platform, for instance Java for Android and Objective-C for iOS.  

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\parskip1ex}X@{\kern4\tabcolsep}>{\parskip1ex}X}
\toprule
\hfil\bfseries Pros
&
\hfil\bfseries Cons
\\\cmidrule(r{3\tabcolsep}){1-1}\cmidrule(l{-\tabcolsep}){2-2}

Best achievable performance\par
Always up-to-date with the latest API\par
Can use any platform\par

&

Low maintainability\par
Harder to find contributors fluent in all technologies\par
Can lead to different versions of the application\par


\\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Pros and cons of the native approach}
\end{table}

\subsection{The web approach}
A second approach we considered was the web approach. This approach consists in using HTML5 to develop an application that will be usable on any platform.


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\parskip1ex}X@{\kern4\tabcolsep}>{\parskip1ex}X}
\toprule
\hfil\bfseries Pros
&
\hfil\bfseries Cons

Can be used on any mobile platform\par
Easy to find contributors fluent in HTML5\par
Easy to maintain\par

&

Doesn't have access to native platform features\par
Not as performant as native\par



\\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Pros and cons of the web approach}
\end{table}
\subsection{The hybrid approach}

The last approach to develop a mobile application is called the hybrid approach. An hybrid app is mostly built using HTML5 and JavaScript and is then wrapped inside a thin native container, giving it access to native features.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\parskip1ex}X@{\kern4\tabcolsep}>{\parskip1ex}X}
\toprule
\hfil\bfseries Pros
&
\hfil\bfseries Cons
\\\cmidrule(r{3\tabcolsep}){1-1}\cmidrule(l{-\tabcolsep}){2-2}

Can be used on any mobile platform\par
Easier to update\par
Easy to find contributors fluent in HTML5 and JavaScript\par
Easy to maintain\par

&

Not as performant as native\par



\\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Pros and cons of the hybrid approach}
\end{table}

\subsection{Our choice}

There isn't one approach that is inherently better than the other two ones, the best one depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

The native approach is best suited when accessing native features of each platform is very important for the application. It is also the choice to be made if you can afford separate budgets for developers in iOS and Android.

The web approach is the best choice if your application is mostly a support for your main web application.

Finally, the hybrid approach is best used when you want a quick result and need to make frequent updates to your application. It is also useful if you want to include outsiders to the project who aren't fluent in all native technologies.


In the context of this thesis, there is no budget therefore choosing the native approach will only depend on the importance of accessing native features. There also won't be a web application, meaning the web approach is probably a bad choice. We believe that making it easier for outsiders to contribute is more important than accessing native features. Indeed, we don't think we will need any feature that would be supported by one platform but not the other and will mainly use generic features. Furthermore, the application will be updated every year (new lecture halls, libraries, ...). We therefore decided to go with an hybrid approach for this thesis.


\subsection{Choosing the best hybrid framework}
There are many different hybrid frameworks and choosing one was no easy task. We were indeed disappointed in the lack of any benchmark regarding their respective performance and realized most people chose base on their personal preference. We were however able to find the following comparison of the most popular frameworks (source http://tutorialzine.com/2015/10/comparing-the-top-frameworks-for-building-hybrid-mobile-apps/)

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | p{2cm} | l | l | l | p{3cm} |}
    \hline
    Framework & Native look and feel & Prerequisites  & Community & Docs & Tools\\ \hline
    Ionic & 7/10 & AngularJS & 9/10 & 8/10 & Powerful CLI, Ionic SDK\\ \hline
    Onsen UI & 6/10 & AngularJS & 4/10 & 9/10 & Monaca Could IDE \\ \hline
    Framework 7 & 8/10 & HTML, CSS and JS & 6/10 & 8/10 & None \\ \hline
    React Native & 8/10 & React & 8/10 & 5/10 & React Developer Tools extension for Chrome \\ \hline
    jQuery Mobile & 3/10 & jQuery & 8/10 & 5/10 & None \\ \hline
   Native Script & 8/10 & JavaScript & 5/10 & 9/10 & Free CLI, other paid options \\ \hline
   Famous & 7/10 & WebGL, AngularJS & 3/10 & 5/10 & None \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

This table seems to be the most complete comparison of hybrid frameworks existing at the moment and it shows that Ionic is the most balanced and that it doesn't have any prominent weaknesses. Despite the lack of objectivity of the measurements used, this table seemed to reflect the opinion of other authors comparing hybrid frameworks. Since realizing benchmarks for all those frameworks would represent a tremendous amount of work that would go well beyond the scope of this thesis, we decided to trust the advice of the aforementioned reviews. We thus decided to use the Ionic framework in the context of this thesis.
\section{Open-source project and code sharing}


\subsection{Open Source And Free Software}
\paragraph{What is an open source, free software?\\}
A free software ensure three freedom:
\begin{itemize}
\item The usage freedom, commercial or not. This allows to use the software for any purpose.
\item The modification freedom. This allows to modify the source code.
\item Distribution freedom. The right to spread the software in every possible way.   	 
\end{itemize} 
An open source software want less strict criteria. For example an open source license can prevent a user to sell a source code or prohibit his modification. The source code for free software meet the open source criteria, not the opposite. A lot of software are free and open source at the same time.

\paragraph{Create an open source project\\}
To create an open source software, you need two conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item A project
\item A community
\end{itemize}

This thesis has for purpose to create a solid foundation for the project. The project exist, it is the UCLCampus application and it is available on mobile. There is no community at this moment, Create a community around the project could be another thesis. A community doesn't mean only programmers, it can be translation student that can help or designer to create logo and icons. 

\subsection{License}
The license are important in every project but even more in an open source project. Licenses restricts the use of the code by other programmers and companies. This section has three parts.
\begin{itemize}
\item Well know licenses in software development and their purpose.
\item The license chosen for UCLCampus and why.
\item The licenses of plugins involved in the application.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Most Common Licenses}
The three licenses GPL(2.0 and 3.0),MIT and Apache represents 72\% of the free software licenses\footnote{\url{https://www.blackducksoftware.com/top-open-source-licenses}}
\paragraph{MIT}
The MIT license allows the right to every person having the source code to use, modify, merge, publish, sell it and change the license. The only restriction is to have the name of the authors with it and the copyright notice.
\paragraph{Apache}
The Apache software foundation allows to use their code the same way than MIT. It only forbid three points\footnote{This three quotes come from their FAQ \url{http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html\#WhatDoesItMEAN}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item "Redistribute any piece of Apache-originated software without proper attribution."
\item "Use any marks owned by The Apache Software Foundation in any way that might state or imply that the Foundation endorses your distribution."
\item "Use any marks owned by The Apache Software Foundation in any way that might state or imply that you created the Apache software in question."
\end{itemize}
The source code has to have a reference to the license instead of being written in every files. 
\paragraph{GPL}
or GNU general public license. This license ensure the right of a free software. Moreover this license is copyleft. Copyleft mean that derived work have to be distributed under the same license. This ensure that the freedom will be preserved whenever the work is distributed.\\
The most used version is the 2 but there exist a new version 3. The two versions have the same goal but the version 3 add some conditions against companies that found tricks to cheat on the version 2\footnote{Tivoization, Laws prohibiting, Discriminatory patent deals \url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html}}
\subsubsection{UCLCampus License}
UCLCampus has the license GNU GPL v3.0. These are the justification of this choice:
\begin{itemize}
\item This license ensure that derived work will keep this license. This prevent companies to take our code, add some features, add advertisements and make money on it.
\item A lot of Ionic plugins use the license Apache 2.0. This license is only compatible with the version 3.0 of GPL.
\item UCL can change it to a more strict license.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Plugins Licenses}
Figure 2.1 show the list of the plugin and their licenses. There is a majority of Apache 2.0 and some MIT. About the compatibility between license, Apache 2.0 and MIT can both be used in GPL 3.0 project. The opposite is not true, GPL 3.0 can not be used in Apache 2.0 and MIT project. Apache 2.0 and GPL 2.0 are not compatible. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
Plugins & License\\
\hline
cordova-plugin-device & Apache 2.0\\
cordova-plugin-console & Apache 2.0\\
cordova-plugin-whitelist & Apache 2.0\\
cordova-plugin-network-information & Apache 2.0\\
Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage adapter & MIT or Apache 2.0\\
PhoneGap Calendar plugin & MIT\\
Cordova-plugin-inappbrowser & Apache 2.0\\
cordova-plugin-geolocation & Apache 2.0\\
cordova-plugin-dbcopy & Apache 2.0\\
Angular-translate & MIT \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Plugins and their associated license}
\end{figure}
\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub is the state of the art for code sharing and project management on open source project. It have a lot of benefits:
\begin{itemize}
\item People can easily copy the code to their own computer and start a derived work. 
\item People can submit their local new features to the project owners as "pull request". The owner can accept or reject them.
\item People can create issues if they found a bug or ask for new functionalities. 
\item There exist plugin to create a forum linked to the git repository. A forum is useful when other programmers has questions about your code or want to discuss new functionalities.
\item There are plugins to test or deploy automatically your project\footnote{Jenkins for example}
\end{itemize}

\section{Existing Student Application}

The number of university application on Google Play is huge. They often offer a schedule, libraries, lecture halls and maps features. However some application are more interesting in the UCLCampus case because they are close or can be directly related to our project.  

\subsubsection{LLN Campus}
LLN Campus was a project developed by 3rd years UCL computer sciences students. This project aims to help the the UCL student in Louvain-la-Neuve. This project is only available for android and is developed in Java. It contains different menus, schedule, libraries, lecture halls, hobbies, map and links to useful student websites (see figure 2.2). They implemented useful features as an indicator for the libraries showing if they are open or not. Their project is available on GitHub. They created a database for Louvain-la-Neuve that we reused in our application. 
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.2]{Images/llncampus.png}
\caption{LLN Campus home menu}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{LLN Maps}
LLN Maps developed to the LSM, is an application based on maps. It is implemented with Ionic. It contains various informations as lecture halls, libraries or train station. This informations are available as markers on a map. A gps guidance with time calculation is possible from the actual position to each points of interest. There is a search bar if a specific information is required. Moreover a compass mode is possible. See figure 2.3 for a visual.

\label{fig:test}
\end{figure}
LLN Maps will be integrated in UCLCampus. 



\subsubsection{Quivr}
Quivr \footnote{\url{https://quivr.be/home/}} is the KUL application. It is not open source. This application is developed by 22 members and have 60 000 users. It has a lot of features and it takes into account all KUL sites, not only Leuven. The different features are a schedule, a friends system, libraries, university restaurants and news. They have really impressive features as a system that tell which library is open and how many places are used. An other feature is to share schedule with friends in order to meet up easily. 


\section{Project Management Methodologies}

Here we detail the choices we made as to how we were going to manage the different parts of the project. We worked on an agile approach with a sprint system. 


\subsection{ZenHub}
ZenHub is a GitHub extension. It is integrated in the GitHub interface and add functionalities as a tasks board and a velocity management.  

\subsubsection{Tasks Board}
Figure 2.4 shows the UCLCampus board. It contains the following column
\begin{itemize}
\item Student. All the tasks relative to the student section. This section only contains the tasks that are not done and that are not in the actual milestone.
\item Campus. Same than student but for the tasks relative to the campus section
\item Tools. Same than student but for the tasks relative to the tools section
\item City. Same than student but for the tasks relative to the city section
\item To Do. The task to finish for the milestone.
\item In Progress. The task that are actually in progress.
\item Done. The finished task during the current milestone.
\item Closed. All the tasks done during the past milestone.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Milestone}

\chapter{Functionalities of UCLCampus}

In this chapter, we will show how we defined the relevant functionalities of our application as well as the user interface.

\section{Choice of functionalities and sections}


In order to define what kind of functionalities we wanted to be part of our application, we needed to know what the students needed. The first step was to define a number of user stories that we would then translate into functionalities.\\ 
We split our user stories into several categories:

\begin{itemize}

\item Studies: anything directly related to a user's studies, for instance his classes, the lecture halls or the libraries.
\item Campus: anything related to student life in the campus but not related to the user's studies. For instance "Kot à Projets" or "Cercles".
\item City: anything related to the city the user is in but not related to the university. For instance a cinema or restaurants.
\item Tools: the tools offered by the application that might relate to several other categories. For example the map.
\item Settings: the settings of the application. For example the language or the currently selected campus.

\end{itemize}

We also define two types of users:

\begin{itemize}

\item Students: students can access all the functionalities of the application using their UCL login information. Indeed, some functionalities are student specific. For instance, it wouldn't make sense for a person who isn't a student to try to access his or her schedule.

\item Users: users are people who aren't students but might still be interested in some functionalities the application has to offer. 

\end{itemize}

In our user stories, any story starting by 'as a student' cannot be used by users while any story starting by 'as a user' can be used by both users and students.\\

We will now give a list of the different user stories we thought of for each of our categories.

\subsubsection{Studies}

\end{itemize}

\section{User interface}

Once we determined the different features we wanted in our application, we needed to organize them in a way that makes sense for users. In order to do so, we made sketches of what the application might look like using InVision. InVision is a website that lets people design and style mobile applications prototypes. It allows us to get an idea of what the finished product might look like without having to dive into any code. The sketches we made are available in the annex.\\

In these sketches, we can see that we decided to have one menu per category we defined in the previous section. Each menu has an associated color, allowing the user to always have visual clues to help them know where they are.\\

Once the sketches were done, we shared the link to our prototype to over 1000 students, mostly student in their first year, as they represent the future users of this application. They were able to browse through the application using the buttons, as if it was already working, and leave comments and feedback wherever they wanted to.\\

While we didn't receive as much feedback as we would have hoped, the one we received was constructive and helpful. Most people were satisfied with our 3 first categories, Studies, Campus and City. The fourth category, however, was more criticized. Here are some comments we received concerning the Tools category.\\

\iffalse
\say{[...] \\ 
 Quelques remarques:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item L'icône "Outils" du menu principal pourrait être renommer par soucis de clarté, on s'attend à tomber sur les "outils" ou paramètres de l'application et non pas du campus/ de la ville.
 \item Je ne vois pas trop l’intérêt de l'onglet mail étant donné que la plupart des étudiants possédant un smartphone ont déjà leur boite mail étudiant connectée. 
 \item L'onglet "Aide" est un peu caché et on ne s'attend pas à trouver ces infos là quand on clique, le lien parking devrait plutôt figurer dans le menu "ville" par exemple. (le renommer "infos utiles", ou qqch de plus parlant que "aide" éventuellement).
 \end{itemize}
 [...]}\\\\
 \say{[...] 2. la partie "mails" est sans intérêt puisqu'on est sur un smartphone où la messagerie est probablement déjà configurée.\\
 3. le menu "Aide" pourrait alors remonter d'un niveau et remplacer "Outils" qui n'est d'ailleurs pas très parlant comme titre de menu}\\
\fi
After reading these comments, we decided to rework the Tools section. We agreed that the mail part was superfluous and we decided to drop it entirely. We also decided to drop the "Help" section as we didn't think it was important enough. That left us with the map. We decided that it was important that the map was not grouped with the city, the studies or the campus as it was important to all three sections. We thus decided to leave it in the Tools section. We also decided against renaming the section "Maps" as future contributors may very well add functionalities we didn't think of in this section.

\chapter{Implementation}


Here we will explain the overall architecture of the application. We will also explain some aspects we considered when implementing the application.

\section{Architecture}

The purpose of the application is to be extensible and easily maintainable. We wanted a programmer to have the possibility to add his functionalities at each level of the application.
For this we thought our implementation as a tree. At the top level we have the generic parts and configurations that will be everywhere in the application under it we have the settings menu and next to it we have four branches pointing to global sections that we decided to create, themselves pointing to their functionalities and so on.

\subsection{Folder organisation}
We wanted to keep the same state of mind for the file organisation. Ionic base architecture is to put all html file in a folder named templates, all js in a JS folder, ... The problem is that become messy once we have a lot of functionalities(thus a lot of files). We modify it to respect the tree architecture we want. With our folder system, a programmer can add his own subtree to the main tree. And if you want to modify a specific functionality, you have directly access to the related files. Figure 4
1 is a summary of the change, red folder are those we modify.

\subsection{Information processing}

Here I just explain how we deal with the information processing from an architecture's design point of view. The section 4.4 explains in detail how we did it for each specific part.
There is a lot of external information to relay into the application (libraries schedule, libraries addresses, daily events in the campus,...). We have two possible ways to import them.

\subsubsection{Database}

\caption{Pros and cons of the web parsing}
\end{table}


An considerable limitation is the need for someone in order to update the database or creating new parsing system. We have no workforce for it, so if we have the choice between the two methods, we will select the one needing less modification in the future.

\subsection{Front-end and back-end}

\begin{itemize}
\item Front-end: Part of the user interface that can be separated in two fields. First is design and the second is html, css and JavaScript development.
\item Back-end: Is the hidden part of the iceberg, what you can't see. For example: the database, the parsing function, ...
\end{itemize}

We create a front-end and a back-end system in our application. It helps a lot for the maintain because you can modify part without involving the other. For example, we store lecture halls in the database but the UCL create a new website with web services providing all lecture halls and their information. It's better than the database because it automatically updates and so you want to use them instead. You can do it in a specific part that is totally isolated from the code for the user interface.	

\subsection{Factory}

Factory is a functionality from angularjs which we used as a back-end service. The factory will take the data from the database or web parsing, modify the data format to be easier to handle and then transmit it to the front-end. Figure 4.2 illustrates this.\\

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{Images/factory_arch.png}
\caption{Factory operation}
\end{figure}

For example, we open the page for the schedule. (1)the system notifies the schedule factory in order to get his data. (2) the factory create a custom HTTP request and send it to the ADE domain. (3) Server sends a response. (4) Data in the response are not easy to manipulate (long string with html tags inside), so the factory pick the important element in the response(with a parsing algorithm) and put them in a JavaScript object where data are easy to handle. (5) Send new data to front-end.

\subsection{State provider}

The state provider is a functionality of angularjs. It allow you to define the page configuration (cached or not for example). Furthermore it create an edge between the back end and the front end, figure 4.3 illustrate the operation of the state provider. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{Images/stateProvider_arch.png}
\caption{State provider operation}
\end{figure}
First the application ask for a page. The state provider contain a list of specific state(one state by page), it will return the state relative to the asked page. The state will contain information about the page:
\begin{itemize}
\item The location of the html template
\item The associate controller(js)
\item A flag for cache memory(true or false)
\item The section membership(for example student if we are in the student tab)
\end{itemize}. For back end data(optional), the state will call the needed factory and wait its response before launching the template and the controller for the user interface. JavaScript(controller) and Html can exchange informations and sent it to back end in some cases.
\iffalse
\begin{lstlisting}
.state('app.name', {
    cache:{true or false},
    url: "/url name",
    views: {
      'appropriate-tab': {
        templateUrl: "html file",
        controller: "page controller(javaScript)",
        resolve:{
          facotry: function(Factory) {
            return Factory.neededData();
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })
\end{lstlisting}
\fi
\section{Coding standards}
\subsection{Header and footer}
We managed our code to create automatically a default new footer and header when you start new html template. The footer and header have a specific color for each tab-section (blue for student, yellow for campus, purple for tools and green for town). We allow developers to overwrite the default header but under two condition
\begin{itemize}
\item The title have to keep the same font and have to be center.
\item The header color must respect the section color
\end{itemize}
Footer must not be overwrite or be hidden. If developers need to insert their specific header or footer, Ionic provide a css in order to add subfooter and subheader.
\subsection{Tree hierarchy}
We want developers to keep the tree hierarchy we created for the state and for the folder. For css and extra JavaScript, html, we don't enforce any rules as long as it stay in the relative module.
\subsection{Colors}
We used the UCL colors code\footnote{https://www.uclouvain.be/459461.html}. For this we modified the sass theme of Ionic. This allow module developed with basic ionic css component to update with the application color instantly and automatically. The main color of UCLCampus is the blue "UCL".

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    Color & css name & code\\ \hline
    Blue & positive & \#00214e\\ \hline
    Yellow & energized & \#f29400\\ \hline
    Purple & royal & \#88005d\\ \hline
    Green & balanced & \#76ad1c\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Security}

This section is not implemented yet because the web services from OSIS wasn't ready but if we had to implement it, that would be this way
Three steps are needed for the security. First what do I need to protect? Second what are the threats and how the opponent can exploit them? Last, what do we need to implement in order to make it impossible? 

\subsubsection{Data to protect}
The only data the hacker can be interest in, are the personal data of the user that means his password and username. He couldn't stole data of the database because the application his open source and they are so available on GitHub. An other thread would be the opponent to modify the data of the database but this is impossible because the database is replicated on local storage and the functionalities only communicate with that one (thus, the only database he can modify, is the local database on his smartphone). About our code, it's available on GitHub due to open source project and it's protected by a license. Therefore the only data that hacker could be interested to steal are the personal data of the user.

\subsubsection{Possible breaks}
There exist two possible way to steal data. The first is if the opponent manage to get the hardware device, in this case, the opponent could try to access and steal data in the local storage. The second threat is to sniff the traffic between the application and OSIS, in this case he could intercept the package containing the request with the password and the username as parameters. 

\subsubsection{Protections}
For the first thread, the password and the username should not be stored on the device (even if they are encrypted). So the solution to this problem would be to create the OSIS request directly when the user insert his credentials. With this procedure, we only store the student courses list and forget the credentials once the response is back. The courses list should not be accessible by an other person than the user but it is less critical than credentials, so in this case, it should be encrypted on the local device. \\
For the traffic sniffing, a solution would be to create a secure connexion with OSIS where packets are encrypted. For example an RSA encryption with public and secret key, UCLCampus would send a first request to obtain a public from OSIS, encrypt the request with it, send it back to OSIS which can decrypt it with the secret key. Due to this procedure, the opponent can catch the packets between OSIS and UCLCampus but can't read or do anything with them (except create false request and brute force password and username but this can be done on the website uclouvain.be).
\section{Information retrieval}

In this section we will detail the different sources of information we used in our application as well as the technologies we had to use in order to retrieve said information. 
\subsection{Student data(OSIS)}
TODO
\subsection{Libraries and lecture halls}

In order to retrieve a list of all libraries and lecture halls in the university, we contacted the UCL to ask them if such a database existed. Sadly, it appeared that no database of this kind exists. We then wondered how LLNCampus managed to obtain all the information they had on lecture halls and libraries. Since their application is also open-source, we were able to find the database they used. Since it was very complete and was the only database available, we decided to re-use this database. However, since their database was built with only one campus in mind, we had to change it a bit.

\subsubsection{Database structure}
 
The database is an SQLite database. The table we use for the most part is called "poi" (point of interest) and has the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item ID (integer): used to identify the item
\item Name (text): name of the point of interest
\item Latitude (real): latitude of the point of interest
\item Longitude (real): longitude of the point of interest
\item Type (text): type of the point of interest, can be "auditoire", "kap",   "bibliotheque", ...
\item Address (text): address of the point of interest
\item Img (text): path to the image linked to the poi
\end{itemize}

To these fields we added the following two:
\begin{itemize}
\item Campus (text): campus where the poi is located
\item Abbr (text): abbreviated version of the poi. For instance "BARB" for the Ste-Barbe lecture hall
\end{itemize}

The first field is useful if we want to have different campuses while the second is used to find the poi on the map.

\subsubsection{Retrieving lecture halls}

Once we had the completed the database, we had to connect it to our application. In order to do so, we used the cordovaSQLite plugin. Once connected, we were able to retrieve the lecture halls using the following SQL query: 
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT * FROM poi WHERE TYPE = 'auditoire' AND CAMPUS = ?
\end{verbatim}

This query will retrieve all the fields from the poi table we discussed earlier which have the type "auditoire" and are located in the desired campus. The "?" character is used as a placeholder for an argument we can pass to the function. We will then store the result of the query in a JavaScript array and used that array to display the information to the user.

\subsubsection{Retrieving libraries}

In order to retrieve all the information concerning libraries, the poi table was not enough. Indeed, we wanted the users to be able to know whether a library was opened or closed and the schedule was not available in the poi table. Thankfully this information was available in another table, called "bibliotheque\textunderscore horaire". This table only has 4 fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item Building\textunderscore ID (integer): identifies the library. Same id as the one used in the poi table.
\item Day (integer): Day of the week (0 for monday, 1 for tuesday, ...)
\item Begin\textunderscore time (integer): Time of the day when the library opens. Given in minutes elapsed since midnight
\item End\textunderscore time (integer): Time of the day when the library closes. Given in minutes elapsed since midnight
\end{itemize}

Given this new table we were able to retrieve all the information we needed using the following SQL query:
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT * FROM poi, bibliotheque_horaire WHERE poi.TYPE = 'bibliotheque' 
AND poi.ID == bibliotheque_horaire.BUILDING_ID AND DAY = ? AND CAMPUS = ?
\end{verbatim}

This query retrieves all poi with type "bibliotheque" and finds their respective schedule for a given day, all that for a given campus. The result in then stored in a JavaScript array.

\subsection{Events}

In order to find events taking place in Louvain-la-Neuve, we used the www.louvainfo.be website. This website provides a schedule of all upcoming events in the city. It is however specific to Louvain-la-Neuve and we would need to find equivalent websites for the other campuses. \\ The website provides an Atom RSS feed of the events. We decided to use Yahoo Query Language to parse the RSS feed and retrieve the information. The reason we used the Yahoo Query language was that it was the only way we found to perform such an operation. Indeed, the more widely used Google Feed API has been deprecated. We therefore had no other choice but thankfully we haven't encountered any issue with YQL.\\
\\We used the following query to retrieve the feed:
\begin{verbatim}
select * from feednormalizer where url='http://louvainfo.be/evenements/feed/calendar/'
\end{verbatim}
The result is then parsed and stored in a JavaScript array. 


\subsection{Schedule}
For the schedule we had no choice between database or web parsing. The ADE dump database for all courses(of all the students) has a size of 70mb which is way too much memory for a mobile application. Therefore ADE has a custom web site where you are able to send customize url in order to extract specific informations. It's a bit worse than web services because you need a parsing technique.
\subsubsection{ADE custom URL}
The request always start with \url{http://horairev6.uclouvain.be/jsp/custom/modules/plannings/direct_planning.jsp?}. After it we can add some query parameters.
\begin{itemize}
\item code : The course code we want to see on the schedule. We picked the logged student courses codes for it.
\item weeks : The weeks we want to see. It's a number per weeks. We wanted to get all the year so we used a suite from 1 to 52 (1,2,3,...).
\item projectID : A number defining the academic year we want to see(16 for 2015-2016). This number need to be manually updated each year. We couldn't update it automatically because it seems to be a random number chosen each year(7 and 16 for the last two years).
\item password and username : Require for ADE connexion.
\item page configuration : There are multiple parameters that I won't explain. Their purpose is to custom the ADE web page we access. We used it to get a tabular summarizing the schedule that is easier to parse than the original web site. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parsing}
Http response contain an html code. The tabular is really useful here in the parsing because it provides a block of informations easy to extract. It contain information about each lecture of the year. Here is the syntax of the tabular in the response.\\
<tbody>\\
\tab <tr>\\
\tab \tab <td>Date</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Course Code</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Hours:Minutes</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Date</td>\\
\tab \tab <td></td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Useless information</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Eleves</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Professors</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Place</td>\\
\tab \tab <td>Course Code again</td>\\
\tab </tr>\\
\tab <tr> an other lecture </tr>\\
\tab ...\\
</tbody>\\
We used a string parsing based on regular expression in order to extract information from tags and place it into a JavaScript object with field easily accessible. At the end the back end sent a list of lecture object to the front end.

\subsubsection{Local storage}
We thought it could be good to keep the schedule relative to the logged student in memory. In this case he could have an access to it every time without the need of an internet connexion. For this, once the parsing done, we keep the new schedule object in memory and the next time the student access the page we load it from local storage instead of parsing it again. That allow us a better performance because it's faster and has a better availability. The problem is that the schedule can change during the year so we allow the student to force a new web request with a new parsing in order to update it (with a refresh button on the page).

\subsection{University canteen}
We choose to store the main informations(name, place, image, opening time) about restaurants in the database because it's  something that will not change every year and there is not a lot of field to update if some modification are needed. We encode the 6 restaurants present on the ucl website\footnote{https://www.uclouvain.be/restaurants-universitaires.html}. For the database we created a new table and encoded data manually. About the menu we couldn't store it in the database because of the existence of the daily menu (we should omit them or update them manually each week). We wanted to do some web parsing but the html code for each restaurant had his own syntax(even if they have the same rendering) ant thus we would need to create one parsing technique by university canteen which was a too heavy workload for the time we had. Instead we chose to create a button linking to the related menu page.
\subsection{Sports}
We couldn't store the sports in a database because the planning undergoes changes every year and we don't have manpower to update it. The sports department don't have web services either so the only solution we had was to parse the website. On a positive note, the Louvain-la-Neuve and Woluwe sites share the same website and thus the parsing is effective for both. 
\subsubsection{URL}
The base url for the two sites is the same \footnote{\url{http://ucl-fms01.sipr.ucl.ac.be:82/ucl_sport/recordlist.php?}}. There exist two main query parameters possible
\begin{itemize}
\item The campus: A number defining the campus for which we want to show the sports schedule(1 for all, 2 for Louvain-la-Neuve, 4 for Woluwe). The factory create a specific request with 2(resp.4) when the selected campus is Louvain-la-Neuve(Woluwe)
\item The skip: The sport web site response contains only 50 sports time slots. The skip argument permit to access the other sports instances after the first fifty.
\end{itemize}
It is a bit more difficult and slower than the other request because in this case we need to create a request by 50 sports time slots(for example if we have 132 sports we need three request. The first taking 0-50 instances, the second 51-100 and 101-132 for the last). Moreover the website is not 100\% available some times, we couldn't access it because it was off line so we added a time-out method in order to prevent the user that the website is probably off-line.
\subsubsection{Parsing}
For the parsing the sport has quite close structure than with the schedule except different tag name so we used an other string parsing method based on regular expression. The sport website create a page that contain the sport closer than the day and the time we are. For example if we Friday 14 hours, it will show the Friday sports time slots after 14 hours first. Thus we iterate over all the time slots until we are sure that we capture all the sport for a week. We stocked the result in an other list of JavaScript object that we store and send to the front end.
\subsubsection{Local storage}
Exactly the same reasoning than for the schedule. Here we saved the result for both Louvain-la-Neuve and Woluwe in different table so we have them both in memory once they has been accessed at least once. Moreover each time the page is requested the software will reorganize the list in order to have the closer time slots first which are in general more suitable for the user. 

\newpage

\chapter{The Application}

In this section we will present the application as we implemented it. In the first time we will explain the design. Secondly, we will explain how it works from a technical point of view. All the page screen described in this section can be found in the annexe X.

\section{The application UCLCampus}

\subsection{Header}
\paragraph{design}
We create a global header for the application. The header has different colours depending on the section (Chap 4.2.3 for more details). Otherwise, it has three components, the first is the name of the page. For example "Sainte-Barbe" if we are looking at the details of this one. The two other components are buttons, the first is the back button, it allows to back to the previous page. The second button open the settings menu. This header is by default enable on all the pages of the application but the programmer can overwrite it if he wants to add something, such as new buttons, search bar,...
\paragraph{Implementation}
Ionic framework provides a file named index.html in its architecture. This file has two purposes. The first is to list all the JavaScript present in the application in order to run them. The second is to create pieces of a user interface that will be available everywhere in the application. These pieces can be overwritten. We used it to create the header, the footer and the settings menu. It's a good point for the maintainability because here we have a single code for every header except if they have been overwritten. Thus it can be modified quickly and efficiently. The implementation of the header will not be described here given its lack of interest. It's only html and css code with components provided by Ionic.
\subsection{Footer}
\paragraph{Design}
The footer is a bar with buttons below the screen. As the header, the footer colour change depending on the section. There are four buttons on the footer, the four main sections (student, campus, tools, city). We thought it was more user-friendly to do that because you don't need to click on the previous page until you reach the main menu if you want to explore another section. For example, if you are looking at the details of a lecture hall and you want to see the events of the week, without footer you need to click three times on the back button to reach the home menu then select campus and events it is five manipulations. With footer, you can click on the campus button and then event, it is only two steps. The footer points out in which section you are, it will greyed out all the buttons except the one representing that one.
\paragraph{Implementation}
Ionic provide all the components and an extended architecture for the tabs(buttons in the footer). When we create a page, we create a state associated with it(see chapter 4.1.5). In this state, we can set an argument specifying the section it belongs. Once it is done, Ionic manage automatically the tabs function. 
For example, if we are on the libraries’ page, there exist a state associate to it, informing that this page belongs to the student section. From that, the framework manages automatically to highlight the student button in the footer in order to show the user that he is in the student section.
For more details\footnote{\url{http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionNavView/}} see figure 5.1, it creates a tree structure of sections, or tabs in the schema. Each section holds a list of views (pages) and his own navigation history stack. The history stack matter for the back button function. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{Images/tabs-nav-stack.png}
\caption{Tabs diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Homepage}
When the user launch UCLCampus on his smartphone, he arrives on the homepage. This page contains the header and four buttons(student, campus, tools, city). The purpose of this page is to not force the user to be in a menu once he opens the application. Another choice could be to put him in the student section and let him use the footer button to navigate between sub menus, we found this solution less comfortable for the user. We remove footer from the homepage because it's redundant to have the sub menu button at the same time as the content of the page and in the footer. No technical details will be given for this page due to lack of interesting parts. It is created with classic HTML, JavaScript and css code.
\subsection{The Student/Campus/Tools/City Menus}
This four sub menus have the same design and are implemented the same way.
TODO lien vers l'annexe des screens ou alors importer l'image. 
\paragraph{Design}
The menu offers a list of buttons. Each button is composed of its functionality name and a representative icon next to it. We choose to remove the back button of the header because it was useless to go back to the main menu. Instead, the user can use the footer buttons to access a new section. 
\paragraph{Implementation}
The four menus have the same code skeleton. The principle is simple, each menu has his own factory. This factory holds a list of objects, each object represents a button. These buttons have different parameters: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Title: The name of the functionality the button is pointing to.
\item Icon: An icon representing the functionality.
\item URL: The technical link to the new page. If this is set, website parameter should be null.
\item Website: The application can open an external website, in this case this field is the URL. If this field is set, URL should be null.
\item Campus: A list of campus where the functionality is implemented. For example, if we set it to ['Louvain-la-Neuve','Woluwe']. If the user's selected campus is one of this, he will see the button on the menu, if not the button is not present. The list can be empty([]), this case is equivalent to write all the campus (more efficient for the programmer). 
\end{itemize}
Then this list is simply passed to HTML and JavaScript controller that use it in order to create the user interface.
\subsection{Studies}
The student menu contains all information relevant to the academic year. All the functionality except libraries and lecture halls are available for every campus. We have libraries and lecture halls informations in database only for Louvain-la-Neuve and Woluwe. 
\subsubsection{Schedule}
For the schedule we didn't want to implement a fresh new calendar algorithm with a lot of functionalities because it's already present on all smartphone as native agenda. So the purpose of this section was allow the student to export their ADE schedule directly to their agenda. Nevertheless we implemented a display function where the student can see the lectures he has for a selected day. In order to implement it we used the data send by the back end (explained in chap 4.4), we display this data as list with
\begin{itemize}
\item Time slot
\item Course code - Professor
\item Local
\end{itemize}
To only display the lecture for a selected day we create a JavaScript filter. In order to let the user select a day we used the onezone datepicker plugin(open source, MIT license\footnote{\url{https://market.ionic.io/plugins/onezone-datepicker}}), it's just a date picker object that display a calendar where you can select the day you want. More, we implemented swipe right and swipe left functions in order to add or remove a day from the actual date.
To export the list of lectures to the native calendar, we used the PhoneGap Calendar plugin \footnote{\url{https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin}}(MIT). It allow us to create, remove and update events in the agenda. However this plugin is still in development and could create some issues, it should not be delivered to end users but we could not find a better solution. We add a button in the header to refresh the schedule if the student need it. 

\subsubsection{Lecture Halls}
We implemented it in two phases. The first an overview of all the halls. For this the controller call a first time the factory method to have all the lecture halls in a list where we can access details efficiently (for example lectureHall.addr,...), in order to display them in the html. This menu use the general header and footer, and just display a list of auditoriums with
\begin{itemize}
\item A picture of it on the left side
\item The name
\item The address
\end{itemize}
If a user has an interest for a specific lecture hall, he can click on it in order to see its details. The details are a bigger image in order to have a better representation of the lecture halls, the address and a button linking to the map with the position and gps preconfigure for it.
From a technical point of view, we call a first time the back end to have the list of all lecture halls and once the user select one, we redirect to a new url with the id as query parameter and we ask the factory again but only for the selected hall details.

\subsubsection{Libraries}
We used the same process than for the lecture halls except for one detail. The libraries have opening time, we found that display directly in the list if the library is closed or open a cool feature. We add it under the address as a small green section with the word open if it is or a red section with closed otherwise. If the user want to see the opening time, we add it in the detail. 
Technically, it was just the same process than for lecture hall with small modifications in order to include the opening times. For this, we add a JavaScript function that takes as parameter the opening time and return true or false.

\subsubsection{Uclouvain.be and Moodle}

Uclouvain.be and moodle are just link to the website in a first time, we think that it is possible to parse both but the Moodle website is already smartphone responsive and has a good display. The website uclouvain.be is too big to parse all informations, so we put a link in our application if the user want to search for specific informations. We choose the browser icon for the button with the aim to inform the user that it open a website and not a functionality we implemented. 
\subsubsection{Implementation}
As explained in chapter 5.1.4 about the sub menus, we set the variable website for uclouvain.be and Moodle. Due to that when the user click on the button we call a function openUrl that we created. In order to open external URLs in Ionic we used the InAppBrowser plugin \footnote{\url{http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/cordova/inappbrowser/inappbrowser.html}} which allow you to open it in application browser, system browser or Cordova webview. The plugin provide a navigation bar but this one has a poor design, so we choose to remove it for android because the user can go back to the application with the physical back button. However, we had to keep it for ios because there is the only way to have a way back to the application. 

\subsection{Campus}
The campus section contains elements relative to live on the campus and that haven't direct link to the academic year. 

\subsubsection{Events}
The events section is only available for the Louvain-la-Neuve campus. All the events informations (including pictures) come from the website \url{http://louvainfo.be/}.
\paragraph{Design}
The events page can be break down in two parts. The first page with the list of all events sorted by starting date and the second part when you click an event in order to obtain its details. 
\paragraph{Events list}
The events list keep the classical header and footer. Each item of the list represent a event with three informations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The name of the event
\item The starting date (date + time)
\item The place
\end{itemize}
Moreover, each event has a category. We create a sub header where the user can open a combobox and select a specific category. Once a category is selected, the list is filter and shows only the relevant events. When a user click on an event in the list, it will open the page details.
\paragraph{Event details} This page has the classic header and footer, the title in the header is the event name. I will describe the element in order of appearance from top to bottom.
\begin{itemize}
\item A picture of the event
\item Start date and time 
\item End date and time
\item The place
\item The description of the event
\item A first button opening the event page on \url{louvainfo.be}
\item A second button opening the place on the map
\end{itemize}
We faced two problem with the description The first is that the RSS only send a text with a max length fixed, thus sometime we are no able to get all the description. In this case, we detect and add "..." to the end of the text so the user now the description is not complete and they can look at it on the website. Second problem, the description is a huge text and it take a lot of place on screen(the user need to scroll down a lot to access the button, it is not user friendly at all). To face it, we created an expandable text. At the beginning we only show the first two lines to the user and bellow then we add a button "$\oplus$ more" once the user click on this button, the full text appear with at the end a new button "$\ominus$ less"(his button reduce the text to the first two line). This allow us to show the user the description and the two buttons bellow it without a scroll need.
\paragraph{Implementation}
For the implementation, it work the same way than for the libraries and lectures halls. The factory find and parse all the data in list(of JavaScript object) that is sent to the JavaScript controller. The controller prepare data for the HTML which display it in order to create the user interface. Same for the details, the factory send the details as a JavaScript object to the controller that send it to the HTML. The list of category that the user can select is create automatically by the application, it look at all event and their category and create a list with them. 
\subsubsection{University restaurants}
As explained in chapter 4.4.5 we only include the restaurants listed on \url{https://www.uclouvain.be/restaurants-universitaires.html}. Thus this functionality is only operational on the Louvain-la-Neuve, Woluwe and Mons campus.
\paragraph{Design}
The design of the restaurants is really close to the libraries, we first have a list of all restaurants in the campus with the following informations.
\begin{itemize}
\item A picture of the restaurant on the left
\item The restaurant name
\item The place
\item Label "open" or "close"
\item Opening on lunch time
\item If exist, evening opening
\end{itemize}
The opening time have always the same format: date - date, time - time (for example Monday to Saturday, from 12h to 14h)
The user can select a restaurant in order to see the details. The details are in order of appearance from top to bottom (the restaurant name is the header title). 
\begin{itemize}
\item A picture of the restaurant
\item Noon time opening 
\item If exist evening opening time 
\item Address
\item Description
\item Button "See on map"
\item Button "Menu"
\end{itemize}
For the description, we used the same way for events and restaurants(an expandable text, see more details in the events section). The button "Menu" open the specific menu url for the restaurant. The button see on map open the map functionality with the restaurant preselect in order to start the gps guide.
\paragraph{Implementation}
The factory retrieve all the database informations to the restaurant controller(js). The controller send the data to the html that is seen by users. We couldn't reuse the javaScript code that detect if a library is open or close because the restaurant could possibly have an evening opening, so we created a new JavaScript file with all utility functions and place it in the folder for restaurants. 
\subsubsection{Sports}
The sport section is available for two campus: Louvain-la-Neuve and Woluwe. 
\paragraph{Design}
There is only one page for the sport. First, we introduce a sub header where the user can select to see only one specific sport or the global schedule with all available sports. Under header, the sports are display into a list. Each sport in the list contain the following details:
\begin{itemize}
\item The name of the sport (for example Badminton). If the user select a specific sport, this information become useless, in this case we remove this field.
\item Day and time (ex: Saturday 20:00 - 21:30)
\item Place 
\end{itemize}
The list is ordered by date and time. The first sport instances in the list are the one of the day. Then it follow a classic order. For example if we look at the sport list a Wednesday, the first sport time slot we will see are those of the day, then those of Thursday and so on. 
\paragraph{Implementation}
The factory retrieve data from website or from database if it has already been parsed. The special trick is that we want the factory to return a list of sport ordered by day starting from the day we are. The UCL sport website already order the sport by date, so we just kept their order while parsing. When the user connect a new day, we will pop the block of sport of the day before it and put them at the end of the list as show in figure 5.2.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{Images/sportsorting.png}
\caption{Sorting day operation}
\end{figure}
The list of sport type(that the user can select in the combo box) is created in the controller. This one automatically update and display sport in alphabetical order. Then the controller communicate all the sport time slots and the list of distinct sports to the HTML that is seen by the user. 
\subsection{Tools}
The actual only functionality of tools are lln maps \footnote{\url{https://github.com/mathieuzen/llnmaps}} . We created the menu in order to introduce new functionalities later. 
\subsubsection{LLN Maps}
\paragraph{Design}
lln maps has its own header and footer so we discuss with our contributors about the way to merge them to our application. First, they have a search side menu so we decide to overwrite our settings side menu that is unreachable from the maps. Therefore, the settings button in the header is replaced by a search button. In their footer, they have a compass or map mode. Actually, we didn't fix a choice, There exist a lot of alternatives.
\begin{itemize}
\item Put the compass button in the header
\item Add it in our footer
\item Create a sub footer
\item Create a sub header
\item Put it on the map page (not in a footer or header) 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Implementation}
We do not pretend to discuss about the implementation of lln maps that is not the purpose of this section. We will discuss the technical points useful for our application. The main interactions with lln maps are the buttons "See on maps" placed throughout UCLCampus. They inform us that we could use url in order to open a preselected place and have the gps ready to be launched. Though lln maps is not fully integrated and thus our button not linked yet, we saw that some abbreviations of lln maps and UCLCampus (for lecture halls,...) are different so we created a database table in order to gather them. 
\subsection{City}
For the city section, we only created the menu in order to add new functionalities later. However, this section is more sensitive than other because it add external business in the application and it is a kind of advertising, so more advanced discussion should take place when adding a functionality.
\subsection{Others}
\subsubsection{Settings menu}
The settings menu can be open everywhere in the application except for the map.
\paragraph{Design}
This menu is a side menu, that mean when the user open it, it does not take all the screen as a new page. Instead it cut the screen in two parts (cut vertically). The part on the left is the page where the user opened the settings menu, the second part is the settings menu. That allows the user to change a setting without being perturbed in its actual task.
The settings menu offers three items:
\begin{itemize}
\item The language
\item The campus
\item Logout
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Language} We introduced three different languages, French, Dutch and English. The student can select one of this three languages and all the application will directly been translated into it. Actually the translation in Dutch is not done (though it is implemented). \\
For the implementation, we used a plugin called "angular-translate" \footnote{\url{https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate}}(MIT). This plugin allows to create a configuration where you define the application languages, and for each languages it hold a kind of dictionary with the variable and his translation.\\
Here is an example of the code for translation:
\begin{verbatim}
        $translateProvider.translations('en', {
            hello_message: "Hello",
            goodbye_message: "Goodbye"
        });
\end{verbatim}
In this example, we create an English translation and the variable "hello\_message" is translated by "Hello" in the user interface (same for goodbye). Our application has more variables to translate but the process is exactly the same. One more step is needed to translate the variable, at each time we want a variable in the html to be translated we need to apply a translation filter onto it. For example 
\begin{verbatim}
		<html tag>{{"hello_message" | translate}}</html tag> 
\end{verbatim}
The plugin allows to set a preferred language that will be preselected at the application launch. Actually it is English.
\paragraph{Campus selection} The user can select a campus with the button named "Choose my campus" in the settings menu. This button open a page with the list of all possible campus, the user has to choose one and validate his choice. As explained earlier the campus selection influences the available functionalities in application. A pre selection based on the geolocation happens when the user open UCLCampus and the nearest campus is chosen per default.\\
For the implementation, we created a campus factory that hold a list of campus. The items of this list have three attributes, the name of the campus, longitude and latitude. In order to select per default the closest campus, we created a JavaScript function that just return the campus minimising the distance between it and the actual position of the user. Thus it is easy to add a new campus to the application or remove one, but the programmers should care about the compatibility between the new campus and all the functionalities enable for all sites. 
\section{Modularity and how to add a new functionality}
This application was built with the idea that other contributors would have to add functionalities themselves or even take over the project in the future. It was therefore important to be able to add modules to the application without having to understand the whole code. 
This section will present a user manual on how to get the application to run from scratch and how to add new functionalities.  It must be noted that in order to deploy the application on iOS, one must user OS X as his operating system.  The following steps will however work for any operating system and the user will be able to deploy the application on Android regardless of the OS used.
\subsection{Setting up the framework}
\subsubsection{Step 1: Installing Git}
First,  we need to install Git.\\
\textbf{For Windows users}: \\
Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win, download and install Git for Windows. Any further commands in this guide can be executed in either the Git Bash. 
\textbf{For Linux users}: \\
Type the following line of code into your terminal:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ sudo apt-get install git
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Step 2: Installing Node.js}

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is required to install the other things one needs to install the application. This step slightly differs depending on your OS.\\

\textbf{For Windows users}: \\
Windows users can download an installer from the Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/ .\\

\textbf{For Linux users}: \\
First, install Node.js by typing the following command line in your terminal:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ sudo apt-get install nodejs
\end{lstlisting}
Then, install npm:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ sudo apt-get install npm
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, create a symbolic link for node:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
\end{lstlisting}
You can now test that the installation worked properly by running these two commands:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ node -v
  v0.10.25
  $ npm -v
  1.3.10
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Step 3: Installing Ionic and its dependencies}
If you are on Windows, drop sudo from the following commands.
\\First, install Cordova:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ sudo npm install -g cordova
\end{lstlisting}
Then, install Ionic:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ sudo npm install -g ionic
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Installing UCLCampus}
Now that you've set everything up, it's time to fetch the source code of the application from GitHub. 
\subsubsection{Step 1: Forking the project}
First, navigate to https://github.com/amoyaux/UCLCampus. Click the Fork button in the top right corner. Note that in order to fork the project, you will need a GitHub account.
Once you have forked the project, open a terminal into the repository of your choice. Then, enter the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/UCLCampus.git
\end{lstlisting}

This will clone the project files into the chosen repository.

\subsubsection{Step 2: Installing the required packages}

Now you will need to install some packages before running the application. To do so, move to the right directory:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ cd UCLCampus/UCLCampus/
\end{lstlisting}
Then run the following commands. These commands, except for the first one, can be found in the plugin.txt file.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ npm install
   $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-device
   $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-console
   $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-whitelist
   $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.network-information
   $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin.git
   $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage.git
   $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
   $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser.git
   $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation
   $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin.git
   $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/an-rahulpandey/cordova-plugin-dbcopy.git
   $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-network-information
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Running the application}

There are several ways to run the application now that it is installed. Note that in order to run it on emulators, you will need to install said emulators and their required dependencies (programming languages, ...). This aspect is not covered in this guide.

\subsubsection{Running the application in an Internet browser}

Since Ionic is an hybrid framework, the application can easily be run in a browser. Simply open a terminal in the UCLCampus/UCLCampus/ folder and run the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ ionic serve
\end{lstlisting} 
The application is now running on http://localhost:8100/ . However, some functionalities may not work properly, namely the ones that need access to the SQLite database. This is due to the fact that opening the database is not done in the same way for a browser or a mobile device. It would be possible to add support for the database in this case, but this was not a priority as the focus of the application is not to be run in a browser.
\subsection{Running the application on a device or emulator}
Once you have installed the emulator or connected the device to your computer, you need to add the corresponding platform to Ionic using the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ ionic platform add android
\end{lstlisting} 

or

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ ionic platform add ios
\end{lstlisting} 
Note that to run the application on an IOS device, you will need a Mac computer. Now that the device is connected and the platform is added, simply run the following the run the application:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ ionic run android
\end{lstlisting} 

or 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
   $ ionic run ios
\end{lstlisting} 
For more options on the launch command, please refer to http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/run.html.
\subsection{Adding a new functionality}
Now that everything is up and running, new functionalities can be added. This guide will explain how to add a new functionality to the Tools section. The same steps can be repeated to add new functionalities to any section of the application.
\subsubsection{Step 1: Creating the required files}
First, you will need to create the required files for your functionality. Navigate to the UCLCampus/UCLCampus/www folder. In this folder, we can see the architecture of the project. It contains one folder for each section of the application. Now, since we want to add a functionality to the Tools section, navigate to the tools folder. Here you can see 3 folders: ''js'', ''templates'' and ''maps''. ''js'' and ''templates'' are the folders that handle the tools menu in the application while ''maps'' is a functionality. So to create a new functionality, you will need to create a new folder.
Create a new folder named ''my\_functionality''. Now navigate to this folder and create two new folders, ''js'' and ''templates''. ''js'' will contain your JavaScript while templates will contain your html code. In the ''js'' folder, create a ''my\_functionality.js'' file and create a ''my\_functionality.html'' file in the ''templates'' folder.
\subsubsection{Step 2: Writing the JavaScript code}
Open your favorite text editor and open the ''my\_functionality.js'' file. In this file, paste the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
   angular.module('ionicApp').controller("MyFunctionalityController", function($scope) {
      $scope.textToDisplay = "This is the text we want to display."
   });
\end{lstlisting} 
\subsubsection{Step 3: Writing the HTML code}
Open the ''my\_functionality.html'' file.   In this file, paste the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
   <ion-view title="Title">
      <ion-content>
         <div>
            {textToDisplay}
         </div>
      </ion-content>
   </ion-view>	
\end{lstlisting} 
\subsubsection{Step 4: Adding your functionality to the application}
To add the functionality to the application you will first need to create a state for it. To do so, open the UCLCampus/UCLCampus/www/js/app.js file. In this file, you will find the state provider. It contains a list of all the states the application can be in. You need to add a state for your functionality. Find this state in the list:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
.state('app.tools', {
    url: "/tools",
    cache : false,
    views: {
      'tools-tab' :{
        templateUrl: "tools/templates/tools.html",
        controller: "ToolsController"
      }
    }
  })
\end{lstlisting} 
This state corresponds to the tools menu. Below this state, add the following new state:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
.state('app.myfunctionality', {
    url: "/myfunctionality",
    views: {
      'tools-tab' :{
        templateUrl: "tools/my\_functionality/templates/my\_functionality.html",
        controller: "MyFunctionalityController"
      }
    }
  })
\end{lstlisting} 
Once this is done, open the UCLCampus/UCLCampus/www/index.html file. In this file, find the following lines:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
   <!-- tools module -->
   <script src="tools/js/tools.js"></script>
\end{lstlisting}
Below these lines, add the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
   <script src="tools/my_functionality/js/my_functionality.js"></script>
\end{lstlisting}
Your functionality has now been added to the application ! However, we don't have a way to access it yet. We will therefore add a button in the tools menu to access it. Open the UCLCampus/UCLCampus/www/js/factory.js file. This file handles, among other things, the buttons we can see in the different menus of the application. Find the function called "ToolsMenuFactory".  In this function you can see the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
   toolsMenuList : [
       { title: 'Maps' , icon:'icon ion-map royal', url:'app.maps', campus:['Louvain-la-Neuve']}
   ], 
\end{lstlisting}
Change it to the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
   toolsMenuList : [
      { title: 'Maps' , icon:'icon ion-map royal', url:'app.maps', campus:['Louvain-la-Neuve']},
      { title: 'My functionality' , icon:'icon ion-help royal', url:'app.myfunctionality', campus:[]}
    ],
\end{lstlisting}
The campus field in each item is used if you want to create functionalities specific to one or several, but not all, campuses. For instance, the maps functionality is currently only available for the Louvain-La-Neuve campus. An empty campus field means that we can access the function from all campuses.
You can now access the new functionality from the tools menu of the application. You can now start editing the JavaScript and HTML files to create a more complicated function.
\subsection{Step 5: submitting your functionality}
Once you have completed a functionality and believe it is ready to be integrated into the application, you can send a pull request to the project owner. The pull request will then be reviewed and will be added to the application if it is accepted. For more information about forks and pull requests, please refer to: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ and https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/.
\section{Future functionalities and possible improvements}
In this section, we will review the functionalities we couldn't add to the current application for various reasons, as well as looking at ways we could improve the existing functionalities.
\subsection{Future functionalities}
\subsubsection{The "City" module}
In chapter 3, we described the "City" module where a user could find information about museums, cinemas, restaurants and so on. This module was not implemented yet for different reasons. The challenging part about such a module is that some restaurants might not want to be listed in the application. Another challenge is the lack of any database concerning the restaurants of a given campus. It would therefore be necessary to list all restaurants, museums and other activity centers of all campuses and possibly ask them whether they want to appear in the application or not.
While this module would certainly be interesting for the user, it would also be hard to keep the information up to date without having someone responsible to update the application every year or so.
\subsubsection{"Cercles" and "Kot à Projets"}
The "Cercles" and "Kot à projets" functionalities were also supposed to be implemented but weren't for reasons similar to the city module. It would also be necessary to list them and ask them if they want to be listed in the application, as well as maintaining the database up to date since "Kot à Projets" change almost every year.
\subsubsection{Integrating OSIS}
At the time  of writing the UCL was changing its infrastructure. Integrating OSIS, the new architecture, into the application was scheduled but sadly couldn't be achieved. OSIS was going to be used to fetch the courses a student is enrolled in at a given time and displaying information about said courses. 
For now the information is given by a dummy server and doesn't correspond to the reality. An interesting thing to do would therefore be to integrate OSIS to the application as soon as possible.  It is indeed our belief that this functionality is of paramount importance if we want the application to be successful. 
\subsubsection{Tools}
The "Tools" module currently only contains the "Maps" functionality. Other functionalities could be added to this module, such as a functionality regarding how to reach a campus using common transportation, or how to park in the city.
\subsection{Possible improvements of existing functionalities}
\subsubsection{Adding support for all campuses}
A lot of functionalities are only supported by a few campuses so far. We list here the functionalities that would benefit from being supported by multiple campuses:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lecture halls
\item Libraries
\item Events
\item Sports
\item University restaurants
\item Cercles
\item Kot à projets
\item The entire "City" module
\item Maps
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Other improvements}
This project currently uses the 1.3 version of Ionic. It is however already possible to use Ionic 2 and migrating the application to this new version could be interesting. At the time of writing Ionic 2 was only available as a beta release, which is why we didn't use it immediately. 
\chapter{Analysis}
Here we will reflect about the many choices we made and try to decide wether they were the right ones or not.
\section{Ionic framework}
\section{GitHub}
\section{Project Management}
\section{Testing}

\subsection{Performance testing}

In order to assess the performance of our application, we profiled it using Google Chrome. Google Chrome indeed has a tool, available using the chrome://inspect address, that allows developers to profile an application running on their Android device. The following results are therefore only relevant for Android phones. The device we used for these tests was a Huawei P8 Lite, a smartphone with average performances (source benchmark). Results may vary with higher or lower end smartphones. Despite the limitations of our testing, the results are still interesting and we will present them in this section.

\subsubsection{Profiling}

We used Google Chrome tool in order to profile several functionalities of our application. It is important to note that monitoring and recording the application's activity adds a bit of overhead and the results we show here will be slightly worse than the ones one would obtain without any monitoring tool. However, the overhead is not important enough to invalidate the results. The idea is to start the profiling, click a button and wait until the next view is displayed. This gives us an idea of how long a user has to wait between views. Figure 6.1 shows the result we obtained when clicking on the "Libraries" button in the Student Menu. The rest the profiles are available in annex X (TODO).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Images/libraries.png}
\caption{Profile of the Libraries functionality}
\end{figure}

In this figure we can see several interesting things. We start by observing that the application takes approximately 1.1 seconds to display the list of libraries. We ignore the last 0.04 seconds displayed in the figure as the work was done and the rest of the time was spent idle. The rest is split among several tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Scripting : Running the JavaScript code. Time spent: 495.601ms, 45\% of total time
\item Loading : Loading different resources (images, ...) from memory. Time spent: 15.734ms, 1.4\% of total time
\item Rendering : Organizing the page layout. Time spent : 125.035ms, 11.4\% of total time
\item Painting : Displaying the view. Time spent : 29.595ms , 2.7\% of total time
\item Other. Time spent : 53.49ms, 4.9\% of total time
\item Idle. Time spent : 385ms, 35\% of total time
\end{itemize}

We can see that, despite displaying several images, the application only spends 14.1\% of its time to render and paint said images. Instead, most of the time is spent scripting. This means that the most time consuming thing the application does when displaying the libraries is finding said libraries in the database and converting the result to a JavaScript list. This behavior seems to remain the same for every functionality of the application. Indeed, scripting is usually the main task in every profile, ranging anywhere from 30 to 60\% of the total execution time. 

We will now look at the execution times of other functionalities: //TODO make a table ??
\begin{itemize}
\item Changing tabs : 489ms
\item Displaying the schedule : 2005ms
\item Displaying the list of sports : 4260ms
\item Displaying the student menu : 700ms
\item Displaying the cafeterias : 1051ms
\item Displaying the campus menu : 970ms
\item Displaying the events : 2890ms
\item Displaying the details of an item (library, lecture hall, ...): ~700ms
\item Displaying the list of lecture halls: 1290ms
\item Displaying the map: 3650ms
\end{itemize}  
From these results, we can observe 3 types of functionalities:

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple display of information already available. Takes less than a second. Examples: changing tabs, loading a menu, displaying details of an item.
\item Display of information available in the local database. Takes between one and two seconds.
\item Display of information available online and maps. Takes more than two seconds.
\end{itemize}

These results make a lot of sense since retrieving information online means we have to wait for the server to respond, which explains the overhead. There is not much we can do to avoid waiting for the server aside from caching the results in the application. Caching the results is also possible for functionalities retrieving information from the database. This technique significantly increases performances but only does so after the user already used the functionality a first time. We observe the following performances once the results have been cached:
\begin{itemize}
\item Displaying the list of lecture halls: 834ms
\item Displaying the list of libraries: 782ms
\item Displaying the cafeterias: 754ms
\item Displaying the schedule: 1530ms
\item Displaying the list of sports: 1350ms
\end{itemize}

We can observe a significant performance increase once the results have been cached in these functionalities, usually around 500ms and almost 3 seconds for the list of sports. This is due to the slow response time of the server we contact to retrieve the sports. The other slower functionalities (maps and events) cannot be easily cached. Indeed, it does not make sense for maps as there are no results to be cached. As for the events, the list is constantly updated and caching the result might lead to inaccurate information being displayed.

We can now see that, once the relevant information has been cached, most functionalities respond in less than a second. We could not find any standard regarding the recommended response time for an application. However, Android will consider the application as not responding if it stuck for more than 5 seconds. As we can see, none of our functionalities exceed this limit, even when not cached.

According to [source TODO], a response time ranging between 500 and 1000 ms is considered to be immediate, which is the recommended interval to load pages. Most of our functionalities are in this range. In order to make the wait for slower functionalities more bearable, we added an indicator that the functionality is loading. That way the user still receives feedback to indicate that his action, in this case the press of a button, has been registered and that the application is working on it. 

We conclude that, despite using a hybrid framework, the performances of our application are acceptable and that most users will not notice any delay when using the majority of the functionalities. Furthermore, the slowest functionalities often depend on the response times of external servers.. In those cases, using a native approach would not have helped performance-wise.
